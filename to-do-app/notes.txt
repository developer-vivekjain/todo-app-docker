Choosing the right Kafka integration option for your REST application depends on various factors like the specific use case, performance requirements, scalability, and development resources. Here's a guide on when to use each option:

1. **Kafka REST Proxy:**
   - When you need quick and simple integration without developing a Kafka client.
   - Ideal for languages or environments where a native Kafka client is not available or feasible.
   - Suitable for low to moderate throughput scenarios.

2. **Custom REST API:**
   - When you need full control over the interaction between your application and Kafka.
   - If you require custom logic or processing of the data before it's sent to or after it's received from Kafka.
   - Good for integrating Kafka with legacy systems.

3. **WebSockets:**
   - When real-time, bi-directional communication is needed.
   - Ideal for applications like live dashboards, real-time notifications, or chat applications.

4. **Connectors (Kafka Connect):**
   - For connecting Kafka with external systems like databases, key-value stores, or other APIs.
   - When you want to minimize coding and use standard connectors for common data sources and sinks.
   - Suitable for scalable, reliable, and maintainable data pipelines.

5. **Streaming Frameworks (Kafka Streams, KSQL):**
   - When you need to perform complex processing or real-time analytics on the Kafka data.
   - Suitable for applications requiring aggregation, joining, or windowing of Kafka stream data.

6. **Server-Sent Events (SSE):**
   - When the client-server communication is one-way (server to client) and real-time updates are required.
   - Good for applications like live news feeds, stock price updates, or live sport scores.

Each of these options has its own set of pros and cons. Your choice should be guided by the specific requirements of your application, such as the need for real-time processing, the nature of client-server interactions, scalability needs, and the existing technology stack.
